## Project Status
Project is: complete


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Refactor the code to match MVC
- Improve the code for creating rings for vehicles

To do:
- Date handler
- Create skeleton shimmer for data, that didn't load yet
- Creating a function for all values, that would add a value change (not just for personal losses)
